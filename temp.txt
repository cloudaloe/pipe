Hi,

I think I've run into this same issue (although I'm not as good tracing under the hood here).
I then migrated my code to Netty 4 Beta (the one released few days ago) and still the same. Write has no effect when adding SSL to the pipeline. the channelFuture's isDone just stays false forever.

My code is Scala that's terribly close to mimicking the mentioned example code and I've changed it to match the flow of the example Java code to try narrow down possibilities. (My code runs a server, then a client sending through one simple http message). When I remove SSL from the pipelines, works as expected.

As an aside, I see that on the Netty 4 examples, only the http client in the closest matching example has SSL enabled for it whereas only the server side example does not, in case this is any indication concerning test coverage of SSL. Possibly the SSL in the example was aborted over the same problem.

I figured I'd address it here rather than stackexchange or the development user group. 
Do you think it's the same issue? is the issue really solved?

Thanks,
Matan
